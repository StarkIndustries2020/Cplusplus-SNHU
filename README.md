Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project was designed to pull the clock from the system and allow the user to manipulate the time through a console window.

What did you do particularly well?

I think keeping the formatting striaght in the project was what I did the best. I made sure the output was always in perfect alignment no matter what the time was. 
--
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I think I could better organize this project by implementing classes for clock and have two subclasses, one for the 12 hour and one for the 24 hour clock. 
--
Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

I found pulling the system clock from the system to be the hardest part of this. I used the c++ documentation and examples online to help me. 
--
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

The skills I find most usefull from this project don't invovle the code itself, but the problem solving skills. How to approach a problem systematically and solve it. I also liked learning the process of pulling system info into a code. That will be very important in the real world I assume. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I tried to put comments in to explain which block was doing which, that way I or anybody else understood what was going on. This wasn't entirely adaptable as it solved a very specific problem.
